            We played Valve's secret new shooter, Deadlock

          Earlier today, I received a no-strings-attached invite to
          play Deadlock on Steam. Steam claims the game is made by Valve. It
          displays Valve’s copyrighted logo when it launches, and its executable
          is digitally signed by “Valve Corp.” The game’s directories contain
          Valve legal notices and numerous other text files that reference
          Valve, and it feels like a Valve game. Though Valve didn’t respond to
          my requests for comment, I’m completely convinced that it’s legit.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-5 mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">So, what is Deadlock?</p>

        <p>
          It’s a 6-on-6 shooter, like the original Overwatch, where your team of
          heroes attempts to dominate a map by slowly wearing down the opposing
          team and pushing them back. But you’re also leading an army of NPC
          grunts down four different lanes to destroy the opposing team’s
          stationary defenses, a little like Dota 2 or other MOBA games.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          There’s no downtime. It’s a constant war between your team’s Troopers
          (the grunts) and the enemy team’s Troopers, which keep respawning and
          advancing on enemy positions, wave after wave. But they can’t break
          through unless the human-powered heroes lend them a hand with powerful
          weapons, abilities, and upgrades.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          Nor can humans easily break through without their NPC army — or at
          least, that’s what I saw in my first match. To take down the
          flame-headed, energy-spewing Guardians or hulking Walkers that block
          your passage, it takes at least a somewhat coordinated effort by one
          human and their little autonomous friends. Each match culminates in an
          all-hands-on-deck fight against the enemy’s Patron, a gigantic
          floating orb with arms and death rays.
        </p>

        </div>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          When I say “coordinated,” I’m not talking about aiming. This isn’t
          a Valorant or Apex Legends-like game where snappy aim is key. It feels
          like Overwatch, or maybe even more so like Team Fortress 2 in its
          floaty, wear-down-their-health gameplay. You can tank, heal, and
          retreat, even if a tremendous amount of enemy fire is coming your way.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          Each match gets deadlier and deadlier as you unlock your heroes’
          abilities and buy skills, many of which give you more damage per
          second. Others provide life steal, shielding, and more. Every
          character also has strong and light melee attacks, and you can parry
          an incoming melee attack to stun your opponent.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          It helps that there are a lot of ways to dodge enemy bullets and
          traverse the map: you can slide, dash, air dash, dash jump, double
          jump, and mantle up to ledges. Each of the game’s four lanes also has
          an aerial tramway that lets you hitch free rides into (and out of) the
          fray. Hopping onto a zip line. GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge

        <p>
          The zip lines don’t feel overpowered; after an earlier leak, I’d once
          heard them compared to Titanfall’s attack-from-any-angle traversal
          gameplay, but Valve keeps them away from the actual firing lines. You
          have to retreat to territory you own before they’ll work.

          They also look like they’ll lead to a fascinating give-and-take
          mechanic as games progress. To power up, I needed to take my hero back
          to a shop to buy new perks with the souls I’d accumulated by
          destroying enemy troopers and heroes, but that left my territory
          undefended. By the time I returned, the front lines had been pushed
          back further than I would have liked.
